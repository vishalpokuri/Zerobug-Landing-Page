# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite project called ZerobugLander. It's a minimal landing page application using:

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- ESLint for code linting
- SWC for fast compilation

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production (runs TypeScript check then Vite build)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on all files
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Architecture

The application follows a standard Vite + React structure:

- `src/main.tsx` - Entry point that renders the App component
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component (currently empty)
- `src/index.css` - Global styles
- `src/App.css` - Component-specific styles

## Build Configuration

- Uses TypeScript with project references (`tsconfig.app.json` for app code, `tsconfig.node.json` for build tools)
- Vite configured with React SWC plugin and Tailwind CSS integration
- ESLint configured with TypeScript, React Hooks, and React Refresh rules

## Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS 4 with the new Vite integration. Styles are configured through the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in `vite.config.ts`.

### Requirements

- The app aesthetic should be grainy matte finish, and also I wanted to use #141414 grey shade and its complement colors.
- This is a landing page, hence I wanted it as great as possible, I wanted you to create the best landing page for the project that Im currently

### About the project

Create a landing page for Zerobug — a cutting-edge, AI-powered, VSCode-style web debugging environment for fullstack developers.

Product Summary:
Zerobug is a developer-first SaaS tool that helps you visualize, simulate, and trace your backend logic—while fully integrated with your frontend. It's built to eliminate fragmented debugging by replacing console logs, Postman, and IDEs with a single, unified web interface.

Tagline:
"Debug smarter. Ship faster. Build with flow."

Key Features:
🔄 GitHub Integration: Import your project directly from GitHub using APIs. No setup needed.

🖥️ Live Code Editing: Edit backend code directly from the browser in a VSCode-like interface.

🧠 AI-Powered Node Flows: Paste your fetch chains or backend logic and get a visual node-based representation auto-generated by AI.

🧩 Frontend + Backend State Sync: Connect your local frontend and backend apps and see real-time state, props, and backend responses.

🧪 Smart Test Simulation: Simulate user flows like login/signup using actual frontend state—no more hardcoding payloads.

🔍 Flow Break Detection: Instantly spot where the request breaks and get actionable fix suggestions.

🧬 Live Route Visualization: Discover all your backend routes and map them visually with connection flows.

📋 One-click Test Generation: AI creates tests based on actual user interactions and edge cases.

⚡ Drag-and-Drop Debugging: Build flows and test them visually using an infinite canvas node-based system.

🗃️ Smart Data Copying: Capture real frontend input and paste it directly into backend testing flows.

🚀 Zero Configuration Automation: Turn manual testing into automated workflows with no setup.

Style Instructions:
Here is the main part, I wanted it to be matte, grainy aesthetic and the main theme accent colors would be #141414 gray and yellow. Very professional
